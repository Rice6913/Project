# Project 2 Banking app
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The goal of this project was to create reliable and secure object-oriented code that computes the balance of a savings account based on the user's input for the interest rate, the number of years, and whether or not a monthly deposit should just be made.

What did you do particularly well?

I was particularly pleased with my use of for loops. I think it is called a nested loop, where I placed a loop inside another loop. Snipped out of code:          

  for (int i = 0; i < years; i++) {

		yearlyTotalInterest = 0;

		for (int j = 0; j < 12; j++) {
    
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

My grade was 100% for this project so I assume it adequately met all the rubric requirements in terms of function and security. In the future I could possibly shorten my class names in my main function and add a clear function for the user?

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Inputting the correct formulas for the calculations was the hardest part for me, I am slow when it comes to math so that was probably the hardest part. Then also having the result print properly gave me some struggle. I referenced Zybooks a lot.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Class inheritance, memory management, and file manipulation are just a few of the transferable abilities from this project. Also, as my coursework and studies advance, I only aim to continue honing my own abilities, which were further strengthened as a result of this project.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

keeping my code clear and uncluttered to make it easy to understand. I find that evenly spaced code is easier to understand, so I assume others benefit as well. Also, line comments for each piece of the code assist others to understand what is being done with that particular section.
